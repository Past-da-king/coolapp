## 5. Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get "CoolApp" up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes bundled with Node.js.
*   **MongoDB Instance:** You'll need access to a MongoDB database. You can:
    *   Install MongoDB locally ([MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)).
    *   Use a cloud-hosted MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas (recommended for ease of setup).

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd coolapp
```

### Installing Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

"CoolApp" requires environment variables for connecting to MongoDB and authenticating with the Google Gemini API.

1.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory (where `package.json` is located).
2.  Add the following variables to `.env.local`, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    ```

    *   **`MONGODB_URI`**: This is your MongoDB connection string. For MongoDB Atlas, it typically looks like `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority`. Ensure you replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster-url>`, and `<database-name>` with your specific details.
    *   **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: Obtain this API key from the Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console. This key is essential for the application to interact with the Gemini AI model.

    **Important Security Note:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control (Git). It's already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.

### Running the Development Server

Once all dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## 6. Usage

Upon launching the application:

*   **Start a New Chat:** If your chat history is empty, you'll be greeted with a friendly message and some prompt suggestions.
*   **Send Messages:** Type your message in the input field at the bottom and press Enter or click the send button.
*   **Attach Files:**
    *   Click the paperclip icon to open a file selection dialog.
    *   Drag and drop files directly into the chat area.
    *   Copy an image or file to your clipboard and paste it into the input field.
    *   Attached files will appear as stylish cards above your message in the input area before sending.
*   **Record Audio:** Click the microphone icon to start recording your voice. Click the stop icon to finish and send the recording.
*   **Clear Chat:** Click the "Clear Chat" button (red pill style) in the top-right corner to delete all messages from your history.
*   **Edit Messages:** Click the edit icon next to your own messages to modify them.

## 7. UI/UX Design Philosophy

The user interface of "CoolApp" has undergone a meticulous redesign to achieve a clean, modern, and intuitive aesthetic, heavily inspired by contemporary chat applications and your specific feedback.

Key design principles and elements include:

*   **Minimalist and Clean Layout:** A spacious, light-themed design with ample whitespace to reduce visual clutter and improve readability.
*   **Soft Shadows and Rounded Corners:** Components feature subtle `box-shadow` and generous `border-radius` (e.g., `rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl`) to give them a soft, elevated, and approachable feel, reminiscent of physical cards or objects.
*   **Consistent Color Palette:** Utilizes a harmonious palette of light grays, whites, and a vibrant blue for user messages, ensuring visual consistency and a pleasant viewing experience.
*   **Intuitive Chat Bubbles:** User and AI messages are presented in distinct, rounded bubbles. User messages are in a clear blue, while AI responses are in a neutral background, making conversations easy to follow.
*   **Stylish Attachment Cards:** A significant focus was placed on the display of attachments. Instead of simple links or embedded images, attachments are rendered as "slick, card-like" elements. Each card features:
    *   **Type-Specific Icons:** Utilizing `react-icons/fi`, each file type (image, audio, document, PDF, etc.) is represented by a relevant and easily recognizable icon.
    *   **Clear File Names:** The file name is prominently displayed alongside its icon.
    *   **Horizontal Arrangement (Input Area):** In the input area, multiple attachments are arranged horizontally, allowing for a quick overview before sending.
    *   **Vertical Stacking (User Messages):** Within user message bubbles, attachments are now stacked vertically, appearing in their own distinct bubble *above* the text message, ensuring clarity and separation of content types.
*   **Fixed "Clear Chat" Button:** The "Clear Chat" button is styled as a prominent "red pill" and is fixed in the top-right corner of the chat interface. This ensures it's always accessible without scrolling, providing a clear and immediate action for the user.
*   **Subtle Transitions:** Minor CSS transitions are applied to interactive elements (e.g., button hovers, sidebar toggling) to provide smooth visual feedback and a more fluid user experience.

## 8. Future Enhancements

While "CoolApp" is fully functional, there are many avenues for future development:

*   **User Authentication:** Implement user login/registration to personalize chat histories.
*   **Multi-User Chat:** Extend functionality to support group conversations.
*   **Advanced AI Features:** Explore more complex Gemini API features like function calling, tool integration, or more nuanced system instructions.
*   **Theming:** Add light/dark mode toggling or custom theme options.
*   **Search History:** Implement search functionality within the chat history.
*   **Message Reactions/Replies:** Add features for reacting to messages or replying to specific messages.
*   **File Previews:** Implement more robust previews for various document types directly within the chat.
*   **Error Handling & Feedback:** Enhance user feedback for API errors or network issues.
